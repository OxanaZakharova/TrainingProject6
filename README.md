Description of the game
Your task is to complete code for a game where the player thinks of a number in some interval, e.g. a number between 0 and 1000 inclusive. The game works like this: The player thinks of a number in the given interval, and the computer tries to guess what number the player is thinking of. The computer will try to use as few guesses as possible. In order to make good guesses, the computer asks the player questions about its guesses.

If the player is thinking of the number 333, the computer might start with a guess of 500, but ask the player “Is your number less than or equal to 500?”. The player must then answer truthfully by entering “T” for true (it is true that 333 is less than or equal to 500) or “F” for false.

When the computer is certain to have the correct guess, it will simply notify the user by outputting something like this: “You were thinking about 333 (took me 10 guesses)”.
